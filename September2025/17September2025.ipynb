    "### **2353. Design a Food Rating System**\n",
    "##### Design a food rating system that can do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `Modify` the rating of a food item listed in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implement the `FoodRatings` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)` Initializes the system. The food items are described by `foods`, `cuisines` and `ratings`, all of which have a length of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `foods[i]` is the name of the $i^{th}$ food,\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `cuisines[i]` is the type of cuisine of the $i^{th}$ food, and\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `ratings[i]` is the initial rating of the $i^{th}$ food.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `void changeRating(String food, int newRating)` Changes the rating of the food item with the name `food`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `String highestRated(String cuisine)` Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of `cuisine`. If there is a tie, return the item with the **lexicographically smaller** name.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.\n",

    "> foodRatings.highestRated(\"korean\"); // return \"kimchi\" <br>\n",
    "> // \"kimchi\" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9. <br>\n",
    "> foodRatings.highestRated(\"japanese\"); // return \"ramen\" <br>\n",
    "> // \"ramen\" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14. <br>\n",
    "> foodRatings.changeRating(\"sushi\", 16); // \"sushi\" now has a rating of 16. <br>\n",
    "> foodRatings.highestRated(\"japanese\"); // return \"sushi\" <br>\n",
    "> // \"sushi\" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16. <br>\n",
    "> foodRatings.changeRating(\"ramen\", 16); // \"ramen\" now has a rating of 16. <br>\n",
    "> foodRatings.highestRated(\"japanese\"); // return \"ramen\" <br>\n",
    "> // Both \"sushi\" and \"ramen\" have a rating of 16. <br>\n",

    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`\n",
    "- `n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length`\n",
    "- `1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10`\n",
    "- `foods[i]`, `cuisines[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- `1 <= ratings[i] <= 10^8`\n",
    "- All the strings in `foods` are **distinct**.\n",
    "- `food` will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to `changeRating`.\n",
    "- `cuisine` will be a type of cuisine of **at least one** food item in the system across all calls to `highestRated`.\n",
    "- At most `2 * 10^4` calls **in total** will be made to `changeRating` and `highestRated`."

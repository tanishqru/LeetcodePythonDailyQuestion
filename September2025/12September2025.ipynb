    "##### Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### You are given a string `s`, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts **first**:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • On Alice's turn, she has to remove any **non-empty substring** from `s` that contains an **odd** number of vowels.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • On Bob's turn, he has to remove any **non-empty substring** from `s` that contains an **even** number of vowels.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play **optimally**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Return `true` if Alice wins the game, and `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The English vowels are: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`.\n",

    "> **Output:** True <br>\n",
    "> **Explanation:** <br>\n",
    "> Alice can win the game as follows: <br>\n",
    "> - Alice plays first, she can delete the underlined substring in `s = \"leetcoder\"` which contains 3 vowels. The resulting string is `s = \"der\"`. <br>\n",
    "> - Bob plays second, he can delete the underlined substring in `s = \"der\"` which contains 0 vowels. The resulting string is `s = \"er\"`. <br>\n",
    "> - Alice plays third, she can delete the whole string `s = \"er\"` which contains 1 vowel. <br>\n",
    "> - Bob plays fourth, since the string is empty, there is no valid play for Bob. So Alice wins the game.\n",

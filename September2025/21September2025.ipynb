    "### **1912. Design Movie Rental System**\n",
    "##### You have a movie renting company consisting of `n` shops. You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Each movie is given as a 2D integer array `entries` where `entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei]` indicates that there is a copy of movie $movie_i$ at shop $shop_i$ with a rental price of $price_i$. Each shop carries **at most** one copy of a movie $movie_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The system should support the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • **Search**: Finds the **cheapest 5 shops** that have an **unrented copy** of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the **smaller** $shop_i$ should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • **Rent**: Rents an **unrented copy** of a given movie from a given shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • **Drop**: Drops off a **previously rented copy** of a given movie at a given shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • **Report**: Returns the **cheapest 5 rented movies** (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list `res` where `res[j] = [`$shop_j$, $movie_j$`]` describes that the $j^{th}$ cheapest rented movie $movie_j$ was rented from the shop $shop_j$. The movies in `res` should be sorted by **price** in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the **smaller** $shop_j$ should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the **smaller** $movie_j$ should appear first. If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented, then an empty list should be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implement the `MovieRentingSystem` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `MovieRentingSystem(int n, int[][] entries)` Initializes the `MovieRentingSystem` object with `n` shops and the movies in `entries`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `List<Integer> search(int movie)` Returns a list of shops that have an **unrented copy** of the given `movie` as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `void rent(int shop, int movie)` Rents the given `movie` from the given `shop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `void drop(int shop, int movie)` Drops off a previously rented `movie` at the given `shop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `List<List<Integer>> report()` Returns a list of cheapest **rented** movies as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Note:** The test cases will be generated such that `rent` will only be called if the shop has an `unrented` copy of the movie, and `drop` will only be called if the shop had **previously rented** out the movie.\n",

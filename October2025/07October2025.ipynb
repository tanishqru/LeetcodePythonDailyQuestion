    "### **1488. Avoid Flood in The City**\n",
    "##### Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the $n^{th}$ lake, the $n^{th}$ lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is **full of water**, there will be a **flood**. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.\n",

    "##### Given an integer array `rains` where:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - `rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - `rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose **one lake** this day and **dry it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Return *an array* `ans` where:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - `ans.length == rains.length`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - `ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### - `ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the $i^{th}$ day if `rains[i] == 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return **an empty array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.\n",

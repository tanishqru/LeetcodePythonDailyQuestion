    "### **3147. Taking Maximum Energy From the Mystic Dungeon**\n",
    "##### In a mystic dungeon, `n` magicians are standing in a line. Each magician has an attribute that gives you energy. Some magicians can give you negative energy, which means taking energy from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### You have been cursed in such a way that after absorbing energy from magician `i`, you will be instantly transported to magician `(i + k)`. This process will be repeated until you reach the magician where `(i + k)` does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In other words, you will choose a starting point and then teleport with `k` jumps until you reach the end of the magicians' sequence, **absorbing all the energy** during the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### You are given an array `energy` and an integer `k`. Return the **maximum** possible energy you can gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Note** that when you are reach a magician, you *must* take energy from them, whether it is negative or positive energy.\n",

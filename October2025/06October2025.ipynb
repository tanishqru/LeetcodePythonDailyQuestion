    "### **778. Swim in Rising Water**\n",
    "##### You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time `t`, the water level is `t`, meaning **any** cell with elevation less than equal to `t` is submerged or reachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Return *the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square* `(n - 1, n - 1)` *if you start at the top left square* `(0, 0)`.\n",

    "### **2125. Numbers of Laser Beams in a Bank**\n",
    "##### Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a **0-indexed** binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an `m x n` 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the $i^{th}$ row, consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. `'0'` means the cell is empty, while `'1'` means the cell has a security device.\n",

    "##### There is **one** laser beam between any **two** security devices if **both** conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • The two devices are located on two **different rows**: $r_1$ and $r_2$, where $r_1$ < $r_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • For **each** row `i` where $r_1$ < i < $r_2$, there are **no security devices** in the $i^{th}$ row.\n",

    "##### Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.\n",

    "### **2043. Simple Bank System**\n",
    "##### You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The bank has `n` accounts numbered from `1` to `n`. The initial balance of each account is stored in a **0-indexed integer** array `balance`, with the $(i + 1)^{th}$ account having an initial balance of `balance[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Execute all the **valid** transactions. A transaction is **valid** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • The given account number(s) are between `1` and `n`, and\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • The amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is **less than or equal** to the balance of the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implement the `Bank` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `Bank(long[] balance)` Initializes the object with the **0-indexed** integer array `balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money)` Transfers `money` dollars from the account numbered `account1` to the account numbered `account2`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `boolean deposit(int account, long money)` Deposit `money` dollars into the account numbered `account`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### • `boolean withdraw(int account, long money)` Withdraw `money` dollars from the account numbered `account`. Return `true` if the transaction was successful, `false` otherwise.\n",

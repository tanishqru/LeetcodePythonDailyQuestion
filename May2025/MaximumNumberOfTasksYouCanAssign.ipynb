    "### **2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign**\n",
    "##### You have ```n``` tasks and ```m``` workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a ***0-indexed*** integer array ```tasks```, with the $i^{th}$ task requiring ```tasks[i]``` strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a ***0-indexed*** integer array ```workers```, with the $j^{th}$ worker having ```workers[j]``` strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength ***greater than or equal*** to the task's strength requirement (i.e., ```workers[j] >= tasks[i]```).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additionally, you have ```pills``` magical pills that will ***increase a worker's strength*** by ```strength```. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker ***at most one*** magical pill.\n",
